Welcome to StealthWatch, the ultimate tool in advanced device monitoring and control. StealthWatch empowers you with unprecedented capabilities to oversee and manage any device it's installed on, ensuring both security and comprehensive surveillance. This README provides a detailed overview of StealthWatch, including its setup, features, and guidelines for use.


## Features
StealthWatch offers a wide range of features designed for meticulous device monitoring and control:

- **Invisible Monitoring Mode:** StealthWatch operates in a completely invisible mode on the monitored device. It does not appear in the list of running programs, and it creates a fake task in the task manager to avoid detection, ensuring that the user of the monitored device is unaware of its presence.

- **Remote Control Operations:** The software allows for a wide range of remote control operations on the monitored device, including:
  - **Wiping the Device:** Securely erases all data by overwriting the storage with zeros, ensuring that no data recovery is possible.
  - **Encrypting the Device:** Applies strong encryption to the device's data, making it inaccessible without the correct decryption key.
  - **Shutting Down the Device:** Remotely turns off the device with a single command.
  - **Disabling USB Ports:** Temporarily or permanently disables all USB ports to prevent external access or data transfer.
  - **Opening Camera View:** Accesses the device's camera in real-time to monitor the surroundings.
  - **Fetching Latest Location:** Retrieves the most accurate location data of the device using GPS or network-based positioning.
  - **Running Custom Code:** Allows the remote execution of custom scripts or commands, offering unparalleled flexibility in monitoring and control.

- **Emergency Mode:** In critical situations, StealthWatch can trigger an emergency mode that plays random sounds and flashes the device's screen to disrupt any unauthorized physical inspection or investigation.

- **Advanced Connectivity Efforts:** StealthWatch employs sophisticated methods to ensure the monitored device remains connected to the internet:
  - **Automatic Public WiFi Connection:** If the device lacks internet access, StealthWatch attempts to connect to nearby public WiFi networks.
  - **Secure, Obfuscated Tunneling:** Establishes a secure, obfuscated tunnel (UDP over TCP) for data transmission, employing quantum-resistant encryption to protect against future cryptographic threats.
  - **Port Scanning and Selection:** Performs a network port scan to identify open ports for communication, adapting to use common ports (like 80 and 443) if necessary.
  - **Brute Force WiFi Access:** In the absence of available networks, StealthWatch can initiate a brute force attack using common passwords to gain internet access.
  - **Evil Twin WiFi Network:** Attempts to create an evil twin WiFi network to deceive other devices into connecting, facilitating password interception.
  - **Satellite Connectivity:** As a last resort, StealthWatch can utilize satellite connections to ensure the monitored device maintains internet access, ensuring continuous monitoring capabilities. This only works if your device has the necessary hardware to connect to a satellite.

- **Network Surveillance:** StealthWatch conducts thorough network surveillance to monitor and analyze all network activities associated with the monitored device. This includes capturing data packets, analyzing network traffic, and identifying potential security threats.

- **Quantum-Resistant Security:** Recognizing the future threat posed by quantum computing, StealthWatch employs quantum-resistant encryption methods for all its communications, ensuring that the data remains secure against emerging cryptographic attacks.


## Ethical and Legal Considerations
StealthWatch is designed for legitimate use cases. Users are responsible for ensuring that their use of StealthWatch complies with all applicable laws and regulations. Unauthorized or malicious use of StealthWatch is strictly prohibited
